## WW500 firmware for this application

The 'ww130_cli' project works with the project 'WildlifeWatcher_1' on the WW500. The WildlifeWatcher_1 code
runs on the MKL62BA (BLE and LoRaWAN processor). Often, developments with the 
HX6538 code will require changes to the WildlifeWatcher_1 code as well.

This folder includes essential/important files from the 'WildlifeWatcher_1' project:

- WildlifeWatcher_1_ww500_a00_000701.zip. 

This file can be installed on the MKL62BA using the DFU mechanism which is documented in the WW130_DFU.md file.
