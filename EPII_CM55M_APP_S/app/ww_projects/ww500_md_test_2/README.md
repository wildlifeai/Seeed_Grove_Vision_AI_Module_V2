# ww500_md_test_2

#### CGP 11/4/25

__NOTE: as of 11/4/25 this is not an active project. I might return to it, or might not.__

Test of  the HM0360 motion detection functionality as implemented on the WW500

Derived from `ww500_md_test_1` which in turn came from `allon_sensor_tflm_freertos`

I got the HM0360 motion detection working OK with the above project. The above project
includes plenty of condition compilation etc to test stuff.

My objective here is to create a minimal set of code, especially relating to motion detection,
that can be added into ww130_cli project (or its successor).
