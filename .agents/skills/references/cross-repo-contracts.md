# Cross-repo contracts

What the mobile app and the nRF firmware depend on here. Never change one of these
unilaterally.

# 6. Cross-repo contracts

EXIF fields (Model, MakerNote), op-parameter indices/defaults, and BLE command syntax are
consumed by ww-mobile-app, ww-website and ww-backend, and mirrored in ww-hardware's
`aiProcessor.h`. Never change one unilaterally: file a `Decide:` issue, agree the
contract, and land the change with the consumers in view.
